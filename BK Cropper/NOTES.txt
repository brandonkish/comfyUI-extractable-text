Create a C# wpf app. The app will:

- Have a large view box on it that scales with the window.
- The app will parse all images in a folder and display them one at a time on the large view box.
- The image will be scaled to completely fit inside of the window.
- dragging an image to the view box or the window of the app will cause the app to open all images in the folder of the image that was dragged onto it. It will first open the image that was dragged to it, then it will continue to parse the folder for all remaining images in the folder.
- right clicking on the window will 1. save the currenlty displayed image as a png in a new folder inside of the set folder called "reviewed". 2. Advance to the next image in the list of images of the folder.
- left clicking on the window will display the previous image in the list.
- when the middle mouse is pressed down the app will allow the user to drag a box over the image. As the user drags with their middle mouse button, a red outline of the box will be displayed to the user while the middle mouse is held down displaying the area they are selecting, it will be displayed as a transparent red rectangle with a red outline. 
- When the user releases the middle mouse button three things will happen:
-- 1. The image will be saved as a png image in the "reviewed" folder
-- 2. The area under the box that the user dragged with their middle mouse button will be used to specify the area that should be transparent in the transparency layer of the png
-- 3. The app will advance to the next image.
- all pngs saved will have 0 compression
- the main window must have AllowDrop="True" in its window tag
- all references to the Path class must have the full path "System.IO.Path." and not just "Path."
- use the project name and workspace name as "BK_Cropper"
- ensure that all possible null references are handled
- Use .NET 10 for the code
- When an image is dragged and dropped on the app, the app will only display images where the png version is not found in the nested "reviewed" folder. The app will only exclude files found in the "reviewed" folder when a image is first dragged and dropped on it.
